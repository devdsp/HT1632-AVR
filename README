This project contains code to interact with LED matrix displays containing
the Holtek HT1632 LED Driver IC from AVR microcontrollers. Sure Electronics is 
a great source of these displays. They make 8x32 and 16x24 displays, both of
which can be found on ebay in both red and green monocolour displays.

This code has been built in the Arduino environment and has some Arduino
idioms. I have tried to remove as much of the Arduino dependancies from the
core library as possible but I'm yet to write test code outside of the Arduino
environment so can't claim that it works.

The driver class supports all three modes and should handle both 8x32 and
16x24 display layouts. As I only have 8x32 displays I can only test on them.

See the example Arduino sketch for an example of streaming columns of data to
the displays. I'll be fleshing out examples as my time permits.
