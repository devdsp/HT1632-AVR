This project contains code to interface AVR micro controllers to LED matrix 
displays containing the Holtek HT1632 LED Driver IC. Sure Electronics is 
a great source of these displays. They make 8x32 and 16x24 displays, both of
which can be found on ebay in either red or green mono colour displays.

This code has been built in the Arduino environment and has some Arduino
idioms. I have tried to remove as much of the Arduino dependencies from the
core library as possible but I'm yet to write test code outside of the Arduino
environment so can't claim that it works.

The driver class supports all three modes and should handle both 8x32 and
16x24 display layouts. As I only have 8x32 displays I can only test on them.

See the example Arduino sketch for an example of streaming columns of data to
the displays. I'll be fleshing out examples as my time permits. These examples
will be released under a more permissive license than the current example.

The MHVlib AVR IO macros and the HT1632 class are both released under LGPL.
The example sketch is released under GPL.
